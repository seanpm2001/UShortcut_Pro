# README - Linux shortcuts

I was inspired to start this project after I noticed how much harder it is to create shortcuts on Linux compared to Windows. It isn't very difficult for intermediate users, but it isn't as obvious.

This shortcut tools will create shortcuts on Linux with advanced functionality, such as adding themes, aliases (on platforms other than MacOS, and also MacOS) custom separate icons, a command line creation mode, and more.

This specific edition is made for Linux. The current supported distributions include:

> * Debian (All versions)

> * Ubuntu (All versions)

> * Kubuntu (All versions)

> * Lubuntu (All versions)

> * Xubuntu (All versions)

> * Edubuntu (All versions)

> * PopOS! (All versions)

> * Red Hat Linux (All versions)

> * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) (All versions)

> * Fedora (All versions)

> * Gentoo Linux (All versions)

> * Linux Mint (All versions)

> * Arch Linux (All versions)

> * Manjaro Linux (All versions)

> * Other versions of Linux (coming soon)

> * Android (separate)

/!\ A Snap version will not be available

Other formats:

> * Appimage

> * Debian file (*.deb)

> * RPM file (*.rpm)

> * Flatpak

> * Source code (*.zip, *.tar, *.tar.xz, *.7z, *.rar) 

> * Other (coming soon)
